Timer
=====

a simple command line timer written in Python

I started this timer script because a while back I looked for a good simple timer application and couldn't find one. I also wanted to learn Python and needed a project.

I expect that I'll be the only one using this. 

# Goals:
* create a functioning timer application
* learn Python
* over time make this more elegant
* potentially add a gui
